# Exoplayer-video-list
This repository contains an Android project that demonstrates a simple implementation of an Instagram-like video reel feature using Exoplayer.
The project uses viewpager2 to display the videos, and Exoplayer to play the videos. 
The video items contain the whole view and only the video item that is completely visible on the screen is played, while the rest are in paused or stopped state.
